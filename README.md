# Web Games

I like to develop some simple web games, sometimes.

## Snake

I've developed 2 versions of Snake.

### Snake v1

When I was a newbie at web developemnt, with less than a year of experience, I wanted to challenge myself.

This is when I figured out I'll develop Snake in just a single day, and the code in the project has never been changed since.

This was around September, 2017, and I'm proud of it, even with it's horrible performance and a game-breaking bug.

The game works, horribly, but it works. It performs really bad, but it works. It saves your highscore in the browser (`localStorage`), which might be usefull, if you ever want to play it more than once.

I'd recommend not to play it, if you don't understand what it takes for a newbie to develop such an amazing game.

### Snake v2

Well, this was a huge improvement over Snake v1. It performs perfectly fine on any hardware, but the game is incomplete.

Looks better, except bad selection of colors, making contrasts really bad.

It does have a few different "maps" you can play, but I never implemented a map selector. Instead, I made the game load a random map on-load.

Bug-free, as far as I know. Feels really natural with the controls, and again, performs perfectly fine on any hardware.

This was developed in 2021, as my first attempt at developing object oriented, for learning purposes.

### Snake v3

So, I want to develop a Snake v3, but will it ever happen? Maybe.

If so, I want it to really show my capabilities, which might include online multiplayer.

But who knows when this will happen? Well, nobody, even I don't know.

## Memgame

During August 2023, a friend needed help with his hobby project, Memgame.

I was inspired by making a copy from scratch, but attempting to make it really difficulty to cheat.

As I'm experienced cheating at text-based web games, I know multiple ways to cheat, even a few complicated ways.

This game was a good one to attempt a few solutions against cheating, and it really makes it challenging for cheaters.

I do know there's a few ways to cheat, but it requires more skills than most cheaters have.

Other than that, the game is fun to play, and it works really well.

Try the game, or maybe you should try cheating at it? That's two decent challenges for you!
